Multivariate optimal allocation
}
\description{
Multivariate optimal allocation for different domains of interest in stratified sample design under a given stratification of the sampling frame
}
\usage{
bethel  (
          stratif,
          errors, 
          minnumstrat=2,          
          maxiter=200,
          maxiter1=25,
          printa=FALSE,
		  realAllocation=FALSE,
          epsilon=1e-11
          ) 
		  }
\arguments{
  \item{errors}{
 Data frame of coefficients of variation for each domain
}
  \item{stratif}{
 Data frame of survey strata
}
  \item{minnumstrat}{
 Minimum number of units per strata (default=2) 
}
  \item{maxiter}{
Maximum number of iterations of the algorithm (default=200)
}
  \item{maxiter1}{
Maximum number of iterations (default=25) of the general procedure. 
This kind of iteration may be required by the fact that when in a stratum the number 
of allocated units is greater or equal to its population, that stratum is set as "census stratum", 
and the whole procedure is re-initialised 
}
  \item{printa}{
If TRUE then two attributes are added to the resulting vector.
The first ('confr') is a comparison between results obtained with 3 different allocation methods: Bethel, proportional and equal.
The second ('outcv') is a table reporting planned and actual CV, together with a sensitivity analysis
}
  \item{realAllocation}{
If FALSE, the allocation is based on INTEGER values; if TRUE, the allocation is based on REAL values
}
  \item{epsilon}{
Epsilon (default=1e-11)): this value is used to compare the difference in results from one iteration to the other; 
if it it is lower than "epsilon", then the procedure stops 
}
}

\value{
A vector containing the computed optimal allocation
