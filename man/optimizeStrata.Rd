Best stratification of a sampling frame for multipurpose surveys
}
\description{
This function runs a set of other functions to optimise the stratification of a sampling frame 
}

	errors , 
	strata , 
	cens = NULL, 
	strcens = FALSE,
	alldomains = TRUE,
	dom = NULL,	
	initialStrata = nrow(strata), 
	addStrataFactor = 0.01, 
	minnumstr = 2, 
	iter = 20, 
	pops = 20, 
	mut_chance = 0.05,

}
\arguments{
  \item{errors}{
  This is the (mandatory) dataframe containing the precision levels expressed in terms of Coefficients of Variation
  that estimates on target variables Y's of the survey must comply 
}
  \item{strata}{
  This is the (mandatory) dataframe containing the information related to "atomic" strata, i.e. the strata obtained by 
  the Cartesian product of all auxiliary variables X's. Information concerns the identifiability of strata
  (values of X's) and variability of Y's (for each Y, mean and standard error in strata) 
}
  \item{cens}{
  This the (optional) dataframe containing the takeall strata, those strata whose units must be selected in 
  whatever sample. It has same structure than "strata" dataframe
}
  \item{strcens}{
  Flag (TRUE/FALSE) to indicate if takeall strata do exist or not. Default is FALSE
}
  \item{alldomains}{
  Flag (TRUE/FALSE) to indicate if the optimization must be carried out on all domains (default is TRUE). If it is set to FALSE,
  then a value must be given to parameter 'dom'
}
  \item{dom}{
  Indicates the domain on which the optimization must be carried. It is an integer value that has to be internal to the interval 
  (1 <--> number of domains). If 'alldomains' is set to TRUE, it is ignored
}
  \item{initialStrata}{
  This is the initial limit on the number of strata for each solution. Default is the number of atomic strata. In cases of more than 
  a domain, it has to be given as a vector, where each element indicates the number of initial strata in each domain.
  If the parameter 'addStrataFactor' is equal to zero, then 'initialStrata' is equivalent to the maximum number of strata to be obtained
  in the final solution.
}
  \item{addStrataFactor}{
  This parameter indicates the probability that at each mutation the number of strata may increase with 
  respect to the current value. Default is 0.01 (1%).
}
  \item{minnumstr}{
  Indicates the minimum number of units that must be allocated in each stratum. Default is 2
}
  \item{iter}{
  Indicated the maximum number of iterations (= generations) of the genetic algorithm. Default is 20
}
  \item{pops}{
  The dimension of each generations in terms of individuals. Default is 50
}
  \item{mut_chance}{
  Mutation chance: for each new individual, the probability to change each single chromosome, i.e. one bit
  of the solution vector. High values of this parameter allow a deeper exploration of the solution space,
  but a slower convergence, while low values permit a faster convergence, but the final solution can be
  distant from the optimal one. Default is 0.05 
}
  \item{elitism_rate}{
  This  parameter indicates the rate of better solutions that must be preserved from one generation
	to another. Default is 0.2 (20%).
}
  \item{highvalue}{
  Parameter for genetic algorithm. Not to be changed
}
  \item{suggestions}{
  Optional parameter for genetic algorithm that indicates one possible solution 
  (maybe from previous runs) that will be introduced in the initial population. 
  Default is NULL.
}
  \item{realAllocation}{
  If FALSE, the allocation is based on INTEGER values; if TRUE, the allocation is based on REAL values.
  Default is TRUE.
}  
  \item{writeFiles}{
  Indicates if the various dataframes and plots produced during the execution have to be written in the working
  directory.
  Default is FALSE.
}
  \item{showPlot}{
  Indicates if the plot showing the trend in the value of the objective function has to be shown or not.
  Default is TRUE.
}
}

\value{
A list containing (1) the vector of the solution and (2) the optimal aggregated strata
