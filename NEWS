Changes in Version 1.0-1

  o Bug fix for old releases.

  o The object returned by function "optimizeStrata" is no more a dataframe but a list:
	* the first element of the list is the solution vector (solution$indices)
	* the second element of the list is the dataframe containing aggregated strata
	  (solution$aggr_strata)

  o In all the functions that previously produced .csv files and .pdf plots in the working 
  directory, as a default this is no more the current behaviour. To write these files, it
  is now necessary to set the "writeFiles" flag to TRUE


Changes in Version 1.0

  o Bug fix for old releases.

  o Two new functions:
    * "evalSolution", to evaluate the found solution in terms of expected target variables 
	precision and bias obtainable by samples drawn from the otpimized frame;
    * "tuneParameters", to determine the best combination of values to assign to the parameters 
	necessary for the execution of the genetic algorithm used for the optimization of the frame 
	stratification.

  o A demonstration on the use of  the "tuneParameters" function is in the vignette "tuneParameters.pdf" 
  contained in the \inst\doc folder.
